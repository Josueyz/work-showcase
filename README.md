## ðŸ“Š Dashboards Included  
- **Tableau Dashboard** â€“ [View here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/josueyanez/viz/Jobapplication-Josue/Dashboard1)  (This is a dashboard using different nationwide variables (Mexico) related to health topics such as birth data, mortality, water quality, etc.)
- **QGIS 3D Map** â€“ [View here](https://josueyz.github.io/lerdo_pub/) (This is a 3D map that combines different variables at the neighborhood level for a municipality. You can see that it integrates population by neighborhood, the number of streetlights, and some other sociodemographic variablesâ€”all in a single map!)
- **Looker Studio Dashboard** â€“ [View here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/c09e7fd3-8f74-4e75-bbd8-703b527b881a) (This is a map that combines geographic information with financial data from a Mexican state (Durango). Specifically, in one tab, you can select each municipality and analyze its trends across different variables such as poverty, lack of healthcare access, etc. In another tab, you can see how public funds have been spent on infrastructure projects. You can select a year, a municipality, and a type of project (e.g., water-related projects) to find out how much was spent, on what, and where the projects were carried out, as well as how many people benefited.) 
- **R Shiny App** â€“ [View here](https://josueyz.shinyapps.io/codigos_r/) (This is a probit model I built in R and deployed online using the Shiny library. Basically, you need to select a combination of the different listed variables: plp (poverty line population) (0 = Not in poverty, 1 = In poverty); Sex (1 = Male (Reference value), 3 = Female); Age; Indigenous culture (1 = Belongs (Reference value), 3 = Does not belong); Type of locality (0 = Urban area (Reference value), 1 = Rural area); Education level (0 = No education (Reference value), 1 = Basic education, 2 = Upper secondary education, 3 = Higher education, 4 = Graduate education); Disability (0 = No disability (Reference value), 1 = Has a disability); Formal employment (proxied by access to health services at work) (0 = Does not have it, 1 = Has it). After selecting the desired values, click "run model." This will fit the model and display a "prediction." The prediction represents the probability estimated by the model that a person, based on the selected characteristics, is in poverty.)
- **Power BI** - [View here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjM3YzNkMDktM2YxMy00NTE5LWJhMDEtMzhkODNlY2JlNzQyIiwidCI6IjljMDM4ZmNkLTE4YmEtNDZlZC1iZGYyLTY1MGY4ZjZhMTgxMSJ9) This Power BI dashboard provides an overview of labor market dynamics in Mexico. Users can filter the data by period, state, and gender to explore trends and regional differences. The main visual elements include a choropleth map, which highlights variations across states, and a line chart that shows the national trend of the average age of the economically active population from 2005 to 2024. Summary cards at the bottom offer a side-by-side comparison of national and state-level indicators,


## ðŸ”§ About This Project  
This simple webpage was built using HTML and CSS and is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. It serves as a central hub for accessing some of the work I've done. I know that the design, aesthetics, colors, and overall harmony of the dashboards could be improved, however, the main objective is to demonstrate my experience with different software and showcase my ability to handle and analyze different types of data.
